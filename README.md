Robobuddy is a computer programming game made for the OLPC Sugar XO laptops. In Robobuddy, the player uses a drag-and-drop styled set of commands to program a robot to complete a math problem.

The code is based on the Sugar Activity Quickstart. Credit for the quickstart repo is given to Robin Brooke, whose blog can be found [here: http://rbrooke.blogspot.com/2010/01/creating-xo-file.html](http://rbrooke.blogspot.com/2010/01/creating-xo-file.html)
